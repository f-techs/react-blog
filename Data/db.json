      "content": "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is used to create single-page applications and mobile applications. React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in the application, which corresponds to the view in the MVC template. It can be used with a combination of other JavaScript libraries or frameworks, such as Angular JS in MVC.\n\nOne of the most important concepts in React is the component. Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an overview of the React documentation and related resources.\n\nReact has a few different kinds of components, but we’ll start with React.Component subclasses:\n\nA Simple Component: React components implement a `render()` method that takes input data and returns what to display. This example uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by `render()` via `this.props`.\n\nA Stateful Component: In addition to taking input data (accessed via `this.props`), a component can maintain internal state data (accessed via `this.state`). When a component’s state data changes, the rendered markup will be updated by re-invoking `render()`.\n\nUsing Props: Props are immutable and are passed from the parent component. They can be used to render dynamic data in the child component.\n\nHandling Events: React elements have event handlers similar to those in DOM elements. The difference is that event names are written in camelCase in React, and with JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.\n\nConditional Rendering: In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.\n\nLists and Keys: First, let’s review how you transform lists in JavaScript. Given the code below, we use the `map()` function to take an array of numbers and double their values. We assign the new array returned by `map()` to the variable `doubled` and log it.\n\nForms: In React, HTML form elements work a bit differently than other DOM elements in that they can maintain their own state. This makes them naturally reusable.\n\nLifting State Up: Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. Let’s see how this works in action.\n\nComposition vs Inheritance: React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components. In this section, we will consider a few problems where developers new to React often reach for inheritance and show how we can solve them with composition.\n\nThinking in React: React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing."

      "content": "State and props are fundamental concepts in React. Props are inputs to a React component and are passed down from the parent to the child component. Props are read-only and should not be modified by the component receiving them.\n\nState, on the other hand, is managed within the component (similar to variables declared within a function). State can be modified using the `setState` method, which triggers a re-render of the component. State is useful for data that changes over time.\n\nTo understand how state and props work together, let’s consider a simple example: a counter app. The counter app has a button that increments a number every time it is clicked. The initial state of the number is set to zero, and each click on the button updates the state to increment the number.\n\nProps and state are often used together in React applications. For example, you might pass a callback function as a prop from a parent component to a child component. The child component can then call the callback function to update the state in the parent component.\n\nHandling state in React can be challenging, especially in large applications with many components. To manage state more effectively, developers often use state management libraries such as Redux or Context API. These libraries provide a centralized store for managing the state of the application, making it easier to share state between components.\n\nThe following sections will cover different aspects of state and props in more detail:\n\nSetting Initial State: The initial state of a component can be set in the constructor or by using a class property. The constructor is a special method in the class that initializes the component’s state and binds event handlers.\n\nUpdating State: To update the state of a component, use the `setState` method. This method takes an object that represents the new state and merges it with the current state. The component will re-render to reflect the new state.\n\nPassing Props: Props are passed to a component in a similar way to how attributes are added to HTML elements. Props can be accessed in the component using `this.props`.\n\nPropTypes: React has a built-in type-checking feature called PropTypes. PropTypes allow you to specify the type of props that a component should receive. This helps catch bugs and ensures that the component is used correctly.\n\nDefault Props: You can specify default props for a component using the `defaultProps` property. Default props are used when no value is provided for a prop.\n\nDerived State: Sometimes, you need to derive state from props. This can be done in the `getDerivedStateFromProps` lifecycle method. This method is called before rendering and returns an object that represents the new state.\n\nUsing Refs: Refs are a special attribute in React that allows you to access the DOM elements directly. Refs can be used to set focus on an input element or to control animations.\n\nControlled Components: A controlled component is an input element that is controlled by the React state. This means that the value of the input element is set by the state, and changes to the input element are handled by the component.\n\nUncontrolled Components: An uncontrolled component is an input element that maintains its own state. This means that the value of the input element is not controlled by the React state, and changes to the input element are handled by the DOM.\n\nLifting State Up: Lifting state up is a technique used to share state between multiple components. This involves moving the state to the closest common ancestor of the components that need to share the state.\n\nHigher-Order Components: A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. HOCs are used to add additional functionality to a component, such as logging or authentication."

      "title": "React Hooks: A Deep Dive",
      "author": "Alice Johnson",
      "content": "Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are functions that let you hook into React state and lifecycle features from function components. The most commonly used hooks are `useState` and `useEffect`.\n\nThe `useState` hook lets you add state to function components. You call it inside a function component to add some local state to it. React will preserve this state between re-renders. The `useState` hook returns an array containing the current state and a function to update it.\n\nThe `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in function components. It is similar to the lifecycle methods `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in class components. The `useEffect` hook takes a function as an argument, which is executed after the component is rendered.\n\nThere are several other hooks in React, each serving a specific purpose. The `useContext` hook allows you to access the context in a function component. The `useReducer` hook is similar to `useState`, but is used for more complex state logic. The `useCallback` hook returns a memoized callback function, which can be useful for performance optimization. The `useMemo` hook returns a memoized value, which can also be useful for performance optimization. The `useRef` hook returns a mutable ref object, which can be used to access DOM elements or store mutable values.\n\nTo understand how hooks work, let’s consider a simple example: a counter app. The counter app has a button that increments a number every time it is clicked. The initial state of the number is set to zero, and each click on the button updates the state to increment the number.\n\nHooks are a powerful addition to React, but they come with some rules. Hooks can only be called at the top level of a function component or"
